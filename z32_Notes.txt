Hi,

I'm having trouble catching the drop event. This is with a very simple example
reordering items in a ListBox.

The code is originally from a post to CodeProject:
    https://www.codeproject.com/Tips/805035/%2FTips%2F805035%2FReorder-DataGrid-ListBox-Items-with-Drag-and-Drop

I've pushed my own code to GitHub:
https://github.com/RayBowman2017b/WPF_DragDrop_ListBox_Example_01

When I set a breakpoint on the handlers that I've defined in code,
they are not hit.
